            <article id="HeaderDescription">The Super Mario Bros. series on the NES began in 1985 with Super Mario Bros., introducing players to Mario and Luigi as they journey through the Mushroom Kingdom to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser. The games are classic 2D side-scrolling platformers, featuring precise jumping, power-ups like the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, and increasingly challenging worlds filled with enemies, secrets, and obstacles. Super Mario Bros. 2 (the U.S. version) added multiple playable characters with unique abilities, while Super Mario Bros. 3 expanded exploration with an overworld map, new power-ups like the Super Leaf, and more varied level design. Across the NES entries, the series combined tight controls, imaginative levels, and colorful graphics, setting the foundation for Mario as Nintendo’s flagship franchise.</article>
