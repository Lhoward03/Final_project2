             <h1 id="head">Mega Man NES Series</h1>
             <article id="headerp"> The Mega Man series, beginning in 1987, follows the adventures of the Blue Bomber, a humanoid robot created by Dr. Light to battle the evil 
                Dr. Wily and his army of Robot Masters. Across dozens of games spanning multiple sub-series—including the classic Mega Man, Mega Man X, Mega Man Zero, 
                Mega Man Battle Network, and Mega Man Legends—the franchise blends action-platforming, strategic boss battles, and unique weapon-collection mechanics. 
                Core gameplay revolves around defeating bosses to gain their special weapons, navigating precise platforming stages, and adapting to increasingly challenging
                enemy patterns. Over time, the series introduced new abilities, companions like Rush and Beat, and variations in style, from side-scrolling action to RPG 
                elements and 3D adventure. With its colorful visuals, memorable music, and iconic gameplay, Mega Man has become one of gaming’s most enduring and influential
                franchises, inspiring countless sequels, spin-offs, and remakes. </article>
